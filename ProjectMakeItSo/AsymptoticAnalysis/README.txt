1. Write an algorithm that takes an array of numbers as inputs and calculates the sum of those numbers​
    ​
2. Define the Tiem Complexity of that algorightm and determine what the lowest possible Time Complexity is for this problem​
    ​
3. Create a program where time complexity is n2 (be able to explain it)​
4. Create a program where time complexity is (log n) complexity ( be able to explain it)
