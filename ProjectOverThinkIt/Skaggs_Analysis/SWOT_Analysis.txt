Strengths:
- The Skaggs Foundation appears to be well funded, and well connected to the community's hospitals and businesses, putting them in a position to funnel resources from one to the other in line with their mission statement.

Weaknesses:
- SF currently has a somewhat weak technological base with which to administer and enable its activities, an issue brought to a head by a recent opportunity.

Opportunities:
- SF has received donations of various products and certificates from various other local companies, with the understanding that these products will be auctioned off to fund SF's various activities. Taking this opportunity makes updating the website a mission-critical goal.

- Professor Ross Lowrance, assisted by several of his students, has volunteered to update the website in question to enable easier maintenance, more flexible use cases, and in particular the opportunity to conduct their winter auctions.

Threats:
- Failure to execute the winter auctions could result in a serious loss of assets, as well as the connections used to acquire those assets.
